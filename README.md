# TDP4 Gun Prices
An API to get TDP4 weapon prices. Built based off of [DPBot](http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/DPBot) code, so usage takes in a message in the form <ul>`how much is weapon [with 50% discount]`</ul> or <ul>`what is the cost of weapon`</ul> (both have variations in regex) and returns an answer. Usage here:<br>
http://www.alphaoverall.com/api/tdp4prices.php?message=how%20much%20is%20colt%20with%2050%%20discount
returns
```json
{"result":"The cost of Colt King Cobra is 500 coins with 50% discount"}
```
Use freely.
